-	Cover<POLICY, CAR> 1:M total/total
-	OWN<CUSTOMER, POLICY> M:N total/total
-	CREATE<CUSTOMER,CLAIM,CAR> 1:M:N partial/total/partial

-	CUSTOMER<SSN, First, MI, Last>
-	CAR<VIN, SSN, color, make, model, year>
	o	FK(SSN) -> CUSTOMER(SSN)
-	POLICY<ID, VIN, SSN, CurrExpDate, StaringDate, Deductible>
	o	FK(VIN)-> CAR(VIN)
	o	FK(SSN) -> CUSTOMER(SSN)
-	CLAIM<Date, AmountOfDamage, SSN, VIN>
	o	FK(VIN) -> CAR(VIN)
